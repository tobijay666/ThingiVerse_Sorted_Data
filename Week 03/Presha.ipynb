    "# 3D Mesh Classification — week 03\n",
    "\n",
    "I worked on a 3D mesh classification task using Python to categorize STL models as either Flat or Free-Form. For this, I used libraries such as trimesh, numpy, pandas, and sklearn.cluster (specifically KMeans). I tested five different geometric methods to analyze the mesh shapes and later selected the two most effective ones—Height Ratio (HR) and Aspect Ratio (AR)—for the final filtering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Height Ratio (HR) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, I calculated the height (Z), width (X), and depth (Y) from each mesh’s bounding box. The formula used was HR = H / max(W, D). If the HR value was less than 0.2, the model was classified as Flat; otherwise, it was categorized as Free-Form. This approach performed very well, being fast to compute and clearly distinguishing flat models such as panels. Its accuracy level was high.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Normal Vector Variation (NV) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method involved calculating all face normals from the mesh and finding the average normal direction. Then, I measured the average angle difference between each normal and the mean. When NV was below 10°, the mesh was considered Flat, while values equal to or above 10° indicated Free-Form. Although the method worked, some meshes produced incorrect results due to surface noise, giving it a medium accuracy level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Normalized Z Variation (ZVar) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, I took all vertex Z-values, computed their standard deviation, and divided it by the total height of the model. The formula was ZVar = std(Z) / H. Models with ZVar less than 0.05 were classified as Flat, and those with ZVar equal to or above 0.05 were Free-Form. This method was effective for simple flat surfaces but struggled with rotated or tilted models, resulting in medium accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Planarity Dominance (PD) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method relied on K-Means clustering applied to face normals to identify the largest planar area. The ratio of the largest plane area to the total surface area was computed using PD = max_plane_area / total_area. If PD was greater than 0.8, the mesh was labeled Flat; otherwise, it was Free-Form. While this method worked well in many cases, it was slower and sometimes inconsistent depending on the clustering outcome. Its accuracy level was variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Aspect Ratio (AR) Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The aspect ratio was computed from the bounding box dimensions of the mesh as AR = min(size) / max(size). Models with AR values below 0.15 were classified as Flat, and those equal to or above 0.15 were Free-Form. This method was extremely fast, stable, and worked correctly even for rotated meshes. It provided consistently high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Results and Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tHeight Ratio (HR) and Aspect Ratio (AR) gave the best accuracy.\n",
    "•\tBoth are easy to compute and don’t depend on mesh quality or rotation.\n",
    "•\tNV, ZVar, and PD were useful but less stable.\n",
    "•\tI finally used only HR and AR for final filtering.\n",
    "•\tAccuracy level was very high with these two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metric\tAccuracy\tComment\n",
    "Height Ratio\tHigh\tClear for flat vs thick models\n",
    "Aspect Ratio\tHigh\tWorks well for rotated meshes\n",
    "Normal Variation\tMedium\tNoise sensitive\n",
    "Z Variation\tMedium\tWorks for simple planes\n",
    "Planarity Dominance\tVariable\tDepends on clustering\n",
